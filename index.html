        <title>Using Bio-Signals to Predict Smoker Status</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>I chose the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/smoker-status-prediction-using-biosignals.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>
        I decided on using this dataset because it provides over 55,000 rows of biological data, including bio-signals like the levels of 
        individual hormones and proteins, about both smokers and non-smokers. I am interested in determining if there are any strong trends 
        or clusters between any combination of these bio-signals and smoking. </p>
